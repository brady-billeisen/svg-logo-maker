# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
SVG Logo Maker is a command-line application that empowers you to effortlessly create custom logos in SVG format. Through a series of prompts, you can input up to three characters for the logo text, choose from shapes such as circles, triangles, and squares, and specify colors using color keywords or hexadecimal numbers. Once all prompts are completed, the application generates an SVG file based on the provided input, using the user-specified filename (including the extension). A confirmation message displaying "Generated [filename]" is shown in the command line. Simply open the generated SVG file in a web browser to view a visually appealing 300x200 pixel image that precisely matches your criteria. Design professional logos effortlessly with SVG Logo Maker.
